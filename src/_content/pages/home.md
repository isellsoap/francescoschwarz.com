2004 was the year when I first learned about and played with web technologies. {{ 'now' | date: '%Y' | minus: 2004 }} years in, I’m still fascinated by how the three frontend pillars HTML, CSS and JavaScript intermesh and thus form the foundation of the web.

At software service provider **jambit** I designed and implemented websites and frontend features for numerous organisations, amongst others **Süddeutsche Zeitung**{lang="de"} and **Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung**{lang="de"}. For the latter, I was a leading part of the team that launched the redesigned website in 2017.

Today I work at **censhare** to improve the workflow between designers and developers by implementing and advancing design systems, always with a strong focus on semantic HTML, maintainable CSS architectures, and accessibility.

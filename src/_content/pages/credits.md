- This website uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/), a static site generator created by the amazing [Zach Leatherman](https://www.zachleat.com/). It‚Äôs actually the first time I used a SSG to build something, and my experiences with it have been flaweless.
- I drew a lot of inspiration and ideas for the code and folder structure from [Paul Robert Lloyd‚Äôs website](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/paulrobertlloyd-v4). It served as a great boilerplate project for me, where I learned how things are being done in Eleventy and how to cleanly structure a project with it.
- The typeface in use is [IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/). Do you like it?
- Thanks to [Gerrit van Aaken](https://praegnanz.de/) for providing and [letting me use](https://twitter.com/gerritvanaaken/status/1002167328208015360) a great template for a DSGVO-compliant [privacy statement](/privacy/). I don‚Äôt know if it is *actually* bullet-proof, but I did my best nonetheless.
- Thanks to [Stefan Judis](https://twitter.com/stefanjudis) for the idea of the [‚ÄúToday I learned‚Äù series](https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/).
- I use [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de/) to host this website. It runs on their latest server setup generation, [Uberspace 7](https://uberspace.de/whatisu7), which includes great things like automatic HTTPS for all domains, HTTP/2, being able to turn off access logs, etc.
- The code for this website is publicly available as a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/isellsoap/francescoschwarz.com) and is being automatically deployed by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/). Two persons in particular helped me with setting up the deployment: Thomas Parisot with the article <cite>[SSH deploys with Travis CI](https://oncletom.io/2016/travis-ssh-deploy/)</cite> and Florian Brinkmann with the article <cite>[Auto deployment to staging and production server with Travis CI](https://florianbrinkmann.com/en/3485/deployment-travis-ci/)</cite>.
- Thanks to Nicolas Gallagher for the idea of aggregating Twitter reactions to articles in a custom collection and link them at the end of articles. For an example scroll down to the bottom of [this article](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/) to see what I mean.
- Thanks to my spouse Dotti for proof-reading *every* relaunch since this website exists in its several stages over the years, and for enduring me talking about nerdy frontend stuff all the time.
- As every project does, also this website depends upon quite a lot of [libraries and tools](https://github.com/isellsoap/francescoschwarz.com/network/dependencies). I think it‚Äôs a great thing to being able to choose from such a vast and interesting tool ecosystem. For that, I‚Äôm more than grateful. üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### üë®‚Äçüíª Work-related projects

#### Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung{lang="de"}

<!--alex ignore die-->

From 2016 to 2017 I was a leading part of the team that launched the redesigned website of the FAZ, one of Germany‚Äôs most significant newspapers with millions of daily visitors. Read what the chief editor at the time wrote about the relaunch in <cite>[Layout, Technik, Ladezeit: Das sind die neuen Seiten von FAZ.NET](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/layout-technik-ladezeit-das-sind-die-neuen-seiten-von-faz-net-15172231.html){lang="de"}</cite>.

#### S√ºddeutsche Zeitung{lang="de"}

From 2013 to 2016 I was part of a team at the SZ that launched a range of projects, e.g. implementing [regional parts](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/kolumne/kompletter-lokalteil-entdecken-sie-ganz-muenchen-in-der-sz-digital-1.1987069) into the apps with intelligent layout automatisms, making the newspaper‚Äôs content available in the browser [through a webapp](https://zeitung.sueddeutsche.de/), releasing a new [ereader edition](https://www.swmh.de/presse/neu-bei-sz-plus-die-e-reader-ausgabe-der-sueddeutschen-zeitung/) of the newspaper, or [redesigning the cover page](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/in-eigener-sache-eine-neue-titelseite-1.3262134) within the apps.

#### jambit{lang="de"}

In 2015 I was responsible for the relaunch of the website of my [former employer jambit](https://www.jambit.com/), which was the [selected site of the week](https://weekly.pw/issue/75/) in the <cite>ProcessWire Weekly</cite>. The relaunch included a complete new frontend, backend and SEO. At jambit I also initiated and organized the ‚ÄúCommunity of practice Frontend‚Äù to raise awarness for frontend topics.

### üë®‚Äçüé® Side projects

#### Specificity Visualizer

In 2017 I launched the [Specificity Visualizer](https://isellsoap.github.io/specificity-visualizer/). It‚Äôs a tool enabling you to identify patterns, trends and inconsistencies across a CSS file in bird‚Äôs-eye view. Especially useful for analyzing big and complex stylesheets.

#### The front-end side of news

In 2016 I created an overview showcasing front-end metrics of big news sites around the world: [the front-end side of news](https://isellsoap.github.io/front-end-side-of-news/).

#### Bare Figures

In 2012 I published the website [Bare Figures](https://barefigur.es/) which enables you to look at quarterly data of major companies through interactive charts. The release attracted wide [media coverage](https://barefigur.es/what-others-say/).

### ü§ù Community involvement

#### ProcessWire

In 2016 I was involved in the community of the [ProcessWire CMS](https://processwire.com/) by initially organizing the repositories for [issues](https://github.com/processwire/processwire-issues) and [feature requests](https://github.com/processwire/processwire-requests). Also, in the same year, I spread the word about ProcessWire by writing articles for [Envato Tuts+](https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/4-reasons-to-choose-processwire-as-your-next-cms--cms-25062), the German print magazine [t3n](https://t3n.de/magazin/cms-processwire-echte-alternative-wordpress-ist-flexibel-241148/){lang="de"}, and [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/the-aesthetic-of-non-opinionated-content-management-a-beginners-guide-to-processwire/).

#### Web Developer Community Meetings

From 2012 to 2013 I was the organizer of [WDCM Dresden](https://www.meetup.com/wdcm-dresden/){lang="de"}, a monthly get-together of web developers, geeks, nerds, and students to discuss web topics in a relaxed atmosphere.

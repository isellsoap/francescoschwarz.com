### General information

As the operator of francescoschwarz.com it is important to me that you know exactly which personal data is collected on this website, how it is processed, and how you can influence it. In particular, I would like to stress that I have no interest in your data. These will only be collected and stored for technical reasons. In doing so, I adhere to the principle of data minimization.

### Hosting and access log

francescoschwarz.com is currently delivered by a server of the German hosting company [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de/). The server location is Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

The web server logs for francescoschwarz.com are disabled, that means connections to this website don’t get logged at all.

### SSL encryption

The data transfer between the web server and your browser is encrypted using SSL.

### Cookies

By default, no cookies are set on this website.

External service providers that are linked to this website via iframes, for example (see also “Embeds or widgets”), usually set their own cookies in order to function better. If you do not wish to have cookies set here, I recommend that you [deactivate the cookie function](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=disable+cookies) in your browser.

### Embeds or widgets

Blog posts can contain content from other web servers, as I like to use specialized providers especially for media content like videos. The external content is usually integrated into so-called iframes, thus opening a connection to the servers of other companies that provide exactly this service. Currently, francescoschwarz.com offers embedded content from:

- YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave, San Bruno, CA 94066, USA (see their [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy))
- Vimeo, Inc., 555 West 18th Street, New York, New York 10011, USA (see their [privacy policy](https://vimeo.com/privacy))

You may find an older blog post that includes a widget from another company. If this is the case, I would be happy to hear from you and add it to the list. If you want to completely prevent your access data from being collected via iframes on the servers of other companies, I recommend a tracking blocker like [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), which can be configured accordingly.

### Statistics and tracking

I renounce any form of web statistics, tracking or fingerprinting. It does not interest me who you are, where you come from, where you go or how many you are.

### Information, correction and deletion

You have the right to receive information about your personal data stored by me at any time. You also have the right to have your personal data or parts thereof corrected or deleted. To do so, send an email to [{{ app.author.email }}](mailto:{{ app.author.email }}). Please note that when you receive this email personal data will be stored in my mail account (see next section).

### Email

If you contact me by email at [{{ app.author.email }}](mailto:{{ app.author.email }}), I will store all the information you send me. I do this in order to be able to react appropriately to your contacting me. I keep direct emails to me permanently in my email account.

### Modification of the data protection declaration

I reserve the right to amend this privacy statement from time to time in order to comply with current legal requirements or to explain changes to my infrastructure. Your renewed visit will then be subject to the new privacy policy.

### Questions about data protection

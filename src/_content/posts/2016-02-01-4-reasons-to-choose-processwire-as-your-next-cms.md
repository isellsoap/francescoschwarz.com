An article I wrote titled <cite>[4 Reasons to Choose ProcessWire as Your Next CMS](http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/4-reasons-to-choose-processwire-as-your-next-cms--cms-25062)</cite> has been published on January 19th at [Envato Tuts+ Code](http://code.tutsplus.com/). That was the first time I wrote an article for a big magazine website, thus I was accordingly excited about the publication.

The writing process was a lot of fun and I could observe how challenging and difficult it is to prepare a topic for a wide audience that is accessible.

The inquiry for the article originally came from [Tom McFarlin](https://tommcfarlin.com/), who wrote to me on Twitter if I were interested in writing an article for Envato. Since Iâ€™m absolutely thrilled by ProcessWire and the philosophy and community behind it, it was a pretty quick decision to make.

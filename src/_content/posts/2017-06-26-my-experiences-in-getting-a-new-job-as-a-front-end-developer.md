February this year I started looking for a job as a Front-End Developer in a new company. After almost four years at [jambit](https://www.jambit.com/en/) it was time for me to leave the contractor business behind. My main motivation for leaving jambit was, in fact, that I didn’t want to work as a contractor anymore but rather work directly at a product company.

### Good bye, jambit

I want to emphasize what a pleasant time I had at jambit. It was my first real job after university and I couldn’t have asked for more. It really is an employee-friendly company and it has a lot to offer (check out [what jambit is all about](https://www.jambit.com/en/about-us/)). I met and worked with great colleagues and had the opportunity to work on exciting projects in the newspaper industry (my main clients were the *Süddeutsche Zeitung Digitale Medien GmbH* and the *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH*). For that, I’m grateful.

### Hello, Stylight

I will join [Stylight’s website team](https://www.stylight.com/) in July, and I’m excited about that. Stylight is Germany’s leading style and shopping guide and has over ten million users world-wide. Since last year Stylight is a subsidiary of the [ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE](http://www.prosiebensat1.de/). What I love about Stylight is that they have an interesting and popular product, are tech-oriented as a company and they give a lot back to the community. Check out the [tech blog](http://tech.stylight.com/), the tech Twitter account [@StylightTech](https://twitter.com/stylighttech), and the [events and meetups](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/stylight/) taking place there. I can’t wait to meet my new colleagues!

### Companies I applied for

I applied for ten companies in total. These are (in alphabetical order):

- [Cliqz GmbH](https://cliqz.com/)
- [Finanztip Verbraucherinformation gemeinnützige GmbH](http://www.finanztip.de/)
- [gutefrage.net GmbH](http://www.gutefrage.net/)
- [HolidayCheck AG](https://www.holidaycheck.de/)
- [Interhyp AG](https://www.interhyp.de/)
- [myposter GmbH](https://www.myposter.de/)
- [Namics (Deutschland) GmbH](https://www.namics.com/)
- [OnPage.org GmbH](https://de.onpage.org/)
- [posterXXL GmbH](https://www.posterxxl.de/)
- [Stylight GmbH](https://www.stylight.de/)

Generally speaking I noticed that the vast majority of front-end job listings in Munich focus mainly on JavaScript application programming. At the same time I was surprised that job positions that understand front-end development in broader terms (like accessibilty, semantics, CSS architecture, performance, being an interface between design and IT, etc.) are rather scarce.

It was interesting getting a sneak peek into how companies think, what is important to them, what their pain points are, how their processes work (or not work), how they communicate with you, etc.

### Numbers, numbers, numbers

- Time span of actual job search: **around two months**.
- Total amount of invested time during that period (job search, phone calls, on-site interviews, etc.): **around 60 hours**.
- Companies that rejected my job application: **three**.
- Companies I rejected a job offer from: **two**.
- Companies where I canceled the ongoing job application process due to time restrictions caused by other offers: **four**.
- Phone and Skype interviews: **six**.
- On-site interviews and team sessions: **six**.

### Best line

During an on-site interview the CEO and the head of software engineering of a company said to me:

> Your letter of motivation is the best we have ever received from an applicant.

### Worst line

In a feedback phone call discussing the reasons for a poor job interview performance on my part, the head of software engineering of a big German website said to me, after I pointed out my areas of interest, passion, and expertise (such as making content as accessible as possible on the web):

> Accessibility is irrelevant for us.

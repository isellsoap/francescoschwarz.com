By default Firefox and Safari on MacOS behave a little weirdly when it comes to tab navigation on websites in that only a few elements on a website are tabable at all (if you are lucky). I experienced this broken behavior together with a colleague during testing the tab navigation behavior for [sz.de](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/).

Active normal tab navigation in **Firefox** by going into the MacOS keyboard settings, click on “Shortcuts” at the top, and activate the “All controls” radio button at the bottom.

Activate normal tab navigation in **Safari** by going into the Safari settings, click on “Advanced” at the top right and activate the “Highlight any object on a web page using the tabulator” checkbox.

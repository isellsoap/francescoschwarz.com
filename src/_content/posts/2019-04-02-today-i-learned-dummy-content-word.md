Open Word, type in the following and hit enter:

```
=rand(5,10)
```

This will create **five** paragraphs consisting of **ten** sentences each.

It’s dummy content, but it’s definitely better than the good ol’ _lorem ipsum_{lang="la"} generated stuff.

Actually I didn’t learn this today. It was yesterday during a training at work, when the instructor, out of the blue, pulled this rabbit out of the hat.

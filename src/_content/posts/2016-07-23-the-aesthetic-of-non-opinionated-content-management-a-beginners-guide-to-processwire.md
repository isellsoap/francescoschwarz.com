After two published ProcessWire articles [in January](/blog/4-reasons-to-choose-processwire-as-your-next-cms/) and [in May](http://t3n.de/magazin/cms-processwire-echte-alternative-wordpress-ist-flexibel-241148/) this year, a third one was published on July 22nd at Smashing Magazine with the title <cite>[The Aesthetic Of Non-Opinionated Content Management: A Beginner’s Guide To ProcessWire](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/the-aesthetic-of-non-opinionated-content-management-a-beginners-guide-to-processwire/)</cite>.

The feedback so far is pretty positive, which is really cool. I want to highlight [one particular compliment](https://processwire.com/talk/topic/2311-processwire-on-the-web/?do=findComment&amp;comment=124425) which comes from [Charles Stevens](https://processwire.com/talk/profile/756-cstevensjr/), a California-based ProcessWire forums moderator:

> That was the best introduction/explanation of ProcessWire that I have ever read. You have an excellent grasp of how things work and know how to convey it in a […] enjoyable writing style.

Thank you!
